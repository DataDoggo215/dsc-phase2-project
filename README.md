## Business Problem


With inflation at an all-time high and wages remaining stagnant, availability of affordable housing continues to decrease while escalating the homelessness crisis. Similar to many prosperous American cities, greater Seattle is experiencing robust economic growth and increasing levels of homelessness. To tackle one facet of homelessness, King County has created an Affordable Housing Committee to serve as a regional advisory body. This committee plans to recommend the creation of more affordable housing units in Kings County. They hired your team to make recommendations on housing features that can keep prices affordable based on King County’s housing data. 

Additional information to consider: Extremely low-income households (ELI), is defined as households earning less than 30 percent of the area median income which is roughly $23,000 per year for a family of four in 2017. The committee has set up a 5-year plan and needs to create 42,405 additional units to meet their goal by 2024. (Information obtained from the following links: )
